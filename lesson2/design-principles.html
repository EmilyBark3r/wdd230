                <p>
                    When you look at nikes website you can see that everyhing
                    looks very clean and very professional.
                    I picked from their website to talk about their clean design because
                    I think with anything you have to have a plan for what your website
                    will look like and I think nike is a great show of that.
                    Their color choices are big on the black and white look but
                    also have a lot of images that have interesting colors like pink, neon green, some blues, and yellows
                    which creates this very streamline and put together look.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The use of white space helps nike create the clean design look
                    but also their webpage has no clutter, and nothing sticks out like a sore thumb.
                    It all fits together and while its simple and a bit minimalistic, I think they balance
                    well the simplicity with pops of color, and of course all thier shoe designs.

                <p>
                        You can see in the images that Deseret Books is 
                    using Emphasis with their image that is holding
                    all these books that you can buy at Deseret Books
                    and its highlighting the 20% off below the image and
                    the Christmas Clearence ad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Emphasis in design is used to catch a viewers attention
                    to something important, in this case they're trying to
                    emphasize the clearence and deals going on right now
                    that will encourage people to shop right now
                    while they can save money.

                <p>
                    You can see in the image from Crumbl Cookies
                    that they've aligned the differnt tools they offer
                    like Catering, Curbside Pick Up, Delivery, Shipping,
                    Gifts, and Subscriptions. Its very easy to read and the images they use
                    are easy to read for all viewing. They also use good alignment with their cookie
                    flavors, you can easily tell what cookie is called what and how many calories it has.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The alignment that they use for their webpage
                    is easy to read and follow along with where you want to travel
                    to in the website. You can find what you're looking for very easily
                    and without the connection and flow of their page, the whole site
                    would feel very chaotic.
